    <p><strong>Newspapers:</strong> Distributed daily by kids mimicking old newsboys. Filled with propaganda that no one fully believes—but everyone reads.</p>
    <p><strong>Radio:</strong> Each zone has at least one underground station. Some stations operate borough-wide but often go dark without warning.</p>
    <p><strong>Transit:</strong> All major lines are severed. Movement between boroughs depends on risky LIRR tracks or trade convoys. Most routes are unmanned but dangerous.</p>
    <p><strong>Urban Legends:</strong> The Man brought the first seeds. The Trolls once lived under the Van Wyck, now rumored to haunt abandoned subways.</p>

    <h2 id="short-story" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #444; padding-bottom: 0.5rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Short Story: The Time of the First Garden</h2>
    <p>The exact day The Man arrived is still disputed. Some say it was spring, others recall the high sun of midsummer. What’s agreed upon is this: he returned day after day, for a full season, clearing an abandoned lot by hand.</p>
    <p>No one remembers which lot came first. The tools were clean. The seeds were dry. And by the end of that season, vegetables had appeared—greens, beets, and something like squash. Not long after, others followed his example.</p>
    <p>The Garden Zone grew block by block. As other boroughs rationed drop shipments, Flushing stopped needing any at all. It was the first truly self-sufficient zone. His name, if he had one, is gone. But the tools? They’re still passed from plot to plot.</p>
